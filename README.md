## Overview

Hide Player UI is a powerful module for [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) that gives users and GMs fine-grained control over the visibility of Foundry's user interface elements. This module is perfect for optimizing screen real estate, especially when broadcasting maps or using Foundry on shared displays.

## Features

1. **Customizable UI Visibility**: Users can choose which UI elements they want to see on their screen.
2. **GM Override**: Game Masters can control what UI elements connecting players are allowed to see.
3. **Flexible Configuration**: Easily toggle visibility for various UI components through an intuitive menu.
4. **Enhanced Immersion**: Hide unnecessary UI elements to focus on the game map and content.
5. **Ideal for Broadcasts**: Perfect for scenarios where Foundry is being used to display maps on a shared screen or stream.
6. **Advanced CSS Selector Hiding**: Users can hide any element on the screen by specifying CSS selectors, providing ultimate control over the UI appearance.

## How It Works

Users can access the configuration menu to select which UI elements they want to display. The GM has additional options to override player settings, ensuring a consistent view for any or all participants when needed.
